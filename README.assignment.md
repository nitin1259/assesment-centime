# Here is the assignment.

## TODO

1. You will create a Page which will have a header (centime logo) and a reusable and scalable chart which contains a type of data representation with inflow and outflows -> Inflow data will be your types of income, Outflow data will be types of expenditures. This diagram is usually called Sankey Diagram.
2. The initial data usually comes from an API - so mock this data as it is coming from an API
3. Afterwards, the user can edit, add or delete the data and it should be reflected in the chart immediately
4. This chart will have basic information like title for each node and upon hovering, user will be able to see some additional information
5. User can change his language and upon change, all the text should have their language changed (Internationalization)

## Learn and Use Below :

React Hooks (classes are being deprecated)
Unit tests for all - Jest
Redux - for transferring the info between components
i18Next - internationalization plugin

## Criteria for evaluation :

Efficient Code
Scalable and Reusable components - VERY IMPORTANT
How well did you use the above mentioned plugins or concepts
Project structure
How well Unit test cases written and their coverage - IMPORTANT
Of Course the actual working of the assignment
Last but not least is the time taken to learn new concepts and complete this assignment
